# Worklog
What I shipped, with numbers when possible: problem, what I did, what changed.

## 2026-10-14: Error tracking and structured logging (OTA-79)
- Problem: errors were invisible: text logs with no request id, nothing reported from the web app.
- Did: JSON logs with a request id on every request line (Nest's own logger, no new logging dependency), Sentry in the API, the web server and the browser, explicit scrubbing tested end to end (headers, cookies, query, body, emails, host name never reach Sentry).
- Numbers: browser JS +63 KB gzip with the Sentry SDK, cut to +41 KB by excluding tracing and debug code (all static chunks, compared with a build of main). Two reviews caught a ReDoS in the redaction (about 50 ms per crafted 16 KB path, now under 20 ms with a test) and unredacted DTO fields. A 500 still answers at once with Sentry hanging or unreachable (test bound: 3 requests under 1 s).
